## Goal
### *How far is it?*

## Sprint Leader: 
### *Andrew Holmes*

## Definition of Done

* The Increment release for `v3.x` created as a GitHub Release and deployed on black-bottle under SPRINT.
* The design document (`design.md`) is updated.
* The sprint document (`sprint.md`) is updated with scrums, completed metrics, review, and retrospective.

## Policies

### Mobile First Design
* Design for mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop in that order.
* Use ReactStrap for a consistent user experience (no HTML, CSS, style, etc.).

### Clean Code
* Code Climate technical debt ratio less than 3.
* Minimize code smells and duplication.

### Test Driven Development
* Write the tests before the code.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
* Code coverage is 70%

### Processes
* Incremental development.  No big bangs.
* Main is never broken. 
* All pull request builds and tests for Main are successful.
* All dependencies managed using Maven, npm, and WebPack.
* GitHub etiquette is followed always.


## Planned Epics


## Metrics

| Statistic | # Planned | # Completed |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Epics | *4* | *count* |
| Tasks |  *18*   | *count* | 
| Story Points |  *34*  | *sum* | 

This sprint we decided to only plan for 4 epics with the intention of spending more time focusing on following proper practice. We will attempt to write new code in a way that doesn't reduce maintainability so there is less time spent cleaning up afterwards. We will also focus more on proper test driven development. If we complete all of our planned epics with time to spare before the sprint deadline we will work to fix any code climate issues before deciding if we have time to take on an additional epic.
