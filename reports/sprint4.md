## Planned Epics


#### Shorter Trip
This will give the user the to choose a trip with a shorter trip. There will be two versions One-opt and Two-opt. Both of these algorithms should take under a second.
The user will be able to see the new map and list before they decide to keep the shorter trip.

#### User Experience
Team members will interview a non-cs314 person to give us feedback for the website. We will create a checklist for the feature we would like to try and use and a feedback form for
the team to know what needs to be implemented next.
